Before we start forking repositories and creating pull requests, let us first discuss where it's most often used for: *open source*.

# Open source

The term **open source** refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, *open source* designates a broader set of values â€” what we call *the open source way*. Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

# Open source software

**Open source software (OSS)** is a computer software program designed and deployed with its source code made available and licensed with a free license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to an anonymous entity for any purpose. Basically, OSS allows anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance its source code.

People using OSS can distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose because open source software is very often developed in a public, collaborative manner.

Here are some famous examples of OSS:
* Linux kernel
* MySQL
* Wordpress
* Mozilla Firefox
* Notepad++

# Why do developers contribute to open source projects?

While some developers start contributing to gain programming experience or build a practical resume, here's what really keeps them motivated to continuously support the open source culture:

**To make things better**. A lot of widely-used OSS such as Linux and Cassandra (from Facebook) started with the idea that there's a better way to do things. When developers are faced with a bug in a software that they're using, they find it really helpful when they can actually offer a solution instead of just reporting the problem. It also serves as a greater motivation to use the software as they become a *part* of how it became what it is today.

**To pay it forward**. As the ones who benefited the most from open source software, developers contribute to open source projects as a way of giving back to the community. After all, programming, and technology in general, wouldn't have progressed as much without open source.

**To have fun**. No matter how noble or inspirational their initial motivations are, they wouldn't have kept contributing if they aren't having fun. According to the [Stack Overflow's Developer Survey last 2015](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#profile-sideprojects), the average developer spends more than 7 hours per week working on side projects and open source software, outside of their normal working hours. To quote the results of the survey:

> For many developers, programming is a labor of love.

## Are you ready to contribute?

To become an open source contributor using GitHub, the largest open source community in the world, you need to know how to fork repositories and submit pull requests.

# Forking a repository

* what is a fork?

* fork `git-party`

* clone forked repo

# Creating a pull request

* what are pull requests?

* add your name to 20180526 attendance

* add, commit, and push to master

* new pull request

* merge pull request

# Syncing forks

* why do we need to sync forks?

* `git remote add upstream <URL>`

* `git fetch upstream`

* `git merge upstream/master`

# Congratulations!

You're now familiar with forks and pull requests!

**Bonus challenge**: try exploring some open source projects and make a contribution!
